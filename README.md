Optimizing Cooperation in Public Goods Games with Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository for my project on exploring and optimizing cooperation dynamics in the Public Goods Game (PGG) using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and Genetic Algorithms (GA).

This project delves into how external parameters like initial resources, group size, and multipliers influence cooperative behavior and demonstrates how we can fine-tune penalties to maximize cooperation in diverse scenarios. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this work bridges the gap between Game Theory and real-world applications in fostering collaboration.

What's Inside
1. Exploring External Factors:
   
This part of the code demonstrates how varying external parameters (such as the number of agents, multipliers, and initial resources) impacts the level of cooperation. The simulation tracks behavior over multiple turns, offering insights into the dynamics of group interactions.

Key features:

-Simulation of diverse parameter combinations.

-Visualization of emergent cooperation or free-riding.

-Analysis of how group size and resource distribution affect outcomes.

2. Optimizing Penalties with Genetic Algorithms:
   
The second part of the code uses Genetic Algorithms to discover the optimal penalty structure for fostering cooperation, regardless of external conditions. By refining penalties over generations, this approach ensures adaptability and robustness.

Key features:

-Dynamic penalty optimization.

-Multi-objective consideration of cooperation and efficiency.

-Scalability for real-world applications.
